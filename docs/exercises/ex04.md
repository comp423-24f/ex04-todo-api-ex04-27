# Ex04: Connecting to FastAPI

Now that you have learned a bit about FastAPI and completed the FastAPI tutorial, we can now revisit the to-do list assignment from earlier and connect the Angular frontend you worked on to a backend via an API! This assignment will include two main parts:
1. Create APIs to manage todo list items.
2. Connect to the API in the frontend to manage a user's todo list items.

## Setup

1. Make sure to follow the steps on the COMP 423 course website on how to accept this assignment via GitHub classroom and on how to clone this repository.
2. Open the repository in VSCode.
3. In the `workspace/docs` folder, you will find a file called `get_started.md`. Please follow the instructions in this file to set up your Docker environment. This typically includes adding a `.env` file to the `/backend` directory and running `pushd frontend; npm install; popd frontend`.
   - The most important step is to go into the existing `workspace/backend` folder and create the `.env` file. Otherwise, your Dev Container will not load. **Do this before trying to build your container!**
   - Note that it may take a while initially to build the Dev Container since this is your first time setting up the container, so don't be worried if it takes several minutes!
4. Once your container builds, be sure to also run `honcho start` to start up your application. _Note: Since there are incomplete parts of the assignment, there may be errors when trying to run `honcho start`._

### GPT/AI Usage Policy

We highly discourage you from using ChatGPT or other AI assistants when working on this assignment. While it is okay to use AI for conceptual questions, we recommend that you practice your ability to find and understand documentation on your own - ChatGPT is sometimes inaccurate, and it often doesn't have knowledge of the design patterns we prefer you to use.

Aside from conceptual help, however, you should _not_ use code sourced from ChatGPT/AI, as this is an Academic Honor Violation. _All code written must be your original work._

## Step 1: Understanding the CSXL Site Architecture

In the first assignment, you worked solely within the `/frontend` directory. This contains the Angular frontend (the "client" side) for the CSXL web application. In this assignment, you will begin to explore the `/backend` directory. This directory contains the backend (the "server" side) of our application, written in Python.

The **backend** of our application is hosted on a server and is responsible for storing all of the data for the CSXL web application, including user's information, reservations at the XL, upcoming events, etc. This information is stored in a **database**. There is one running instance of the database on the server, and in the backend, _service functions_ provide functionality to perform **CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations** on the data in the database. For example, there may be a `OrganizationService` which has a method `.get_organizations()`, which retrieves all of the XL organizations from the XL's datbase.

Below is a _summary_ diagram showing the architecture that we are working with:

<img width="1580" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-29 at 7 50 37â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/387cfe8e-3943-4f77-b519-16a014a96818">

As you can see from both the diagram and our discussions in class, **APIs** are the **_bridge_** that connect our frontend to our backend. With APIs, our frontend can both read data from our backend and the databse, and our frontend can also modify that data.

## Step 2: Understanding the `TodoService`

We have created a new database table to store todo list items. We have also created a **service class** called **`TodoService`** that have methods to perform CRUD operations on this new table. This service is located in the `/backend/services/todo.py` file. You can see that this service as _four_ main methods:

- `TodoService.all(subject: User) -> list[TodoItem]`: Retrieves all of the todo list items for a given user (provided as `subject`).
- `TodoService.create(subject: User, item: TodoItem) -> TodoItem`: Adds a new todo list item to the database for a given user, then returns the newly added item.
- `TodoService.toggle_checkmark(self, subject: User, item: TodoItem) -> TodoItem`: Toggles the checkmark status of any todo list item for the given user, then returns the modified item.
- `TodoService.delete(self, subject: User, item: TodoItem)`: Deletes a todo list item for a given user.

As you can see, these four methods make up the four CRUD operations (**\*r**ead\*, **\*c**reate\*, **\*u**pdate\*, **\*d**elete\*) respectively. These methods have already been written for you, so you do not need to modify this file. In the next exercise, you will have a chance to explore services and how they modify the database more in-depth.

## Step 3: Completing the APIs

The first part of this assignment is to _complete the FastAPI APIs for the todo list items_. We can find the API file at `/backend/api/todo.py`.

You will find one of the four APIs has already been completed for you:

```py
@api.get("", response_model=list[TodoItem], tags=["Todo"])
def get_todos(
    todo_service: TodoService = Depends(),
    subject: User = Depends(registered_user),
) -> list[TodoItem]:
    """API to get all todo items."""
    return todo_service.all(subject)
```

Notice two things. First, this API is marked as a `GET` api using the `@api.get(...)` decorator. In addition, this API calls the `TodoService.all()` method to retrieve all of the todo list items for a user.

Note that the `TodoService` is _injected_ into this method using `Depends()`, passed in as the parameter `todo_service`. You can use this parameter to call service methods and interact with the todo list data. Use this in all of your three API implementations. In addition, the currently logged-in user is also retrieved by injecting the `registered_user` into the `subject` parameter. Use this `subject` parameter wherever the service method expects `subject` as an input.

Your task is to implement the remaining three APIs. Use the appropriate service method calls to call the right CRUD operation for your API. Make sure to use the correct HTTP request types (from `GET`, `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) to implement your APIs.

## Step 4: Calling these APIs from the Frontend

Now that you have created the todo APIs in our backend, let's use these APIs in our frontend code to interact with our backend todo list data.

This assignment has provided the `TodoComponent` for you, as well as the start of the `TodoService`. Your task will be to complete the remaining `TodoService` in `/frontend/src/app/todo/todo.service.ts`.

The `todoList` signal from ex02 remains in the service - we will use the same techniques to modify our signal data as we did in ex02, so refer back to your ex02 solution for these.

Like the backend API section, one of the four service methods have been created for you:

```ts
  /**
   * Retrieves all of the todo items from the database.
   */
  getItems() {
    this.http.get<ToDoListItem[]>(`/api/todo`).subscribe({
      next: (items) => this.todoList.set(items),
      error: (err) => console.log(err)
    });
  }
```

This method uses Angular's `HttpClient`, dependency injected as `http`, to call APIs. We call the `/api/todo` endpoint (which you will also use for completing the three other services) using the `GET` HTTP request type to retrieve data. Our data is returned in the form of an _Observable_.

As shown in lecture, we can then _subscribe_ to our observable to retrieve the data inside. We can supply a function into the `next` parameter of the subcription object that performs an action with our retrieved data. In this arrow function, we will modify the `todoList` signal to represent our new data. _You will need to do this for your three methods as well - refer back to ex02 to see how you added to, modified, and deleted from the signal list!_ You can also supply a function into the `error` parameter of the subscription object that performs an action if an error occurs. For this assignment, feel free to just print out the error to the console.

## Final Steps: View Your Work!

Congratulations! You just connected your frontend project from ex02 to the XL's backend. While you should have also been testing each method/button as you created them, this is also a good opportunity to check for any bugs. It's always a good idea to manually test your feature once you complete it to ensure everything works.

**Note: Please go back over your API functions and frontend service functions to include proper docstrings and documentation. Please explore the given functions, as
well as other files, for a model.**

## Submission

Once your code is fully tested, push your code up to your Github repository using `git push`. Then, go to Gradescope and complete the exercise submission there!

_Note:_ Be sure to record your demo video before you close out your container to avoid having to rebuild! :)
